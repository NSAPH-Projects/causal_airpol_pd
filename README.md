### Aim: Examine the effect of annual exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on the rate of first hospitalization with a PD-related diagnosis (hospitalization with PD) among Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries (2001-2016)

### Methods: Fitted four models: 1) traditional outcome stratification, 2) marginal structural, 3) doubly robust, and 4) generalized propensity score matching Poisson regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic and meteorological confounders and long-term trends
